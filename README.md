# 🐭 Rat in a Maze Solver

A visual simulation of the classic "Rat in a Maze" problem, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The algorithm explores all possible paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid-based maze.

## 🎯 Features

- Interactive grid-based maze generation
- Depth-First Search (DFS) pathfinding logic
- Visual path traversal with animation
- Start and end point customization
- Clean and responsive UI using pure CSS

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The maze is represented as a 2D array of cells.
2. Cells are marked as either `1` (open path) or `0` (wall).
3. The rat moves from `(0,0)` to `(n-1,n-1)` using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
4. The valid path is highlighted in real-time as the rat explores.
